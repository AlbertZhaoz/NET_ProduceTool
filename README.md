# ProduceTool

This producetool is used for four items:

1. git extensions
2. produce(work item-->pull request-->review-->checkin)
3. simple web crawler
4. azure analysis
5. baget extensions
6. tool cp

# Getting started

1. Click Code-Download ZIP or Open cmd.exe and run commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/AlbertZhaohongyong/producetool.git
```

2. Open ProduceTools-Albert.sln by visual studio2019/2022.Rebuild solution(If some nuget is missing, you must restore nuget package).Tools-Nuget Package Manager-Package Manager Console

```
msbuild -t:restore
```

3. If you run Albert.sln successfully, you need to enter the bin\Debug\net5.0 folder of the project.Then, you must set the environment variables like this:

```
environment variables Path E:\Gitee\producetool\ProduceTools\bin\Debug\net5.0
```

4. Run cmd.exe to perform some supported operations like:

    Exceptionless Readme
```

---

Exceptionless provides real-time error reporting for your apps. It organizes the
gathered information into simple actionable data that will help your app become
exceptionless!

Learn more at http://exceptionless.io.

---

```
    How to get an api key
```

---

The Exceptionless client requires an api key to use the Exceptionless service.
You can get your Exceptionless api key by logging into http://exceptionless.io
and viewing your project configuration page.

---

General Data Protection Regulation
----------------------------------

By default the Exceptionless Client will report all available metadata including potential PII data.
You can fine tune the collection of information via Data Exclusions or turning off collection completely.

Please visit the documentation https://exceptionless.com/docs/clients/dotnet/private-information/
for detailed information on how to configure the client to meet your requirements.

---

```
  ASP.NET Core Integration
```

---

You must import the "Exceptionless" namespace and add the following code to register and configure
the ExceptionlessClient inside of the ConfigureServices method:

services.AddExceptionless("API_KEY_HERE");

In order to start gathering unhandled exceptions, you will need to register the Exceptionless
middleware in the Configure method like this:

app.UseExceptionless();

Alternatively, you can also use the different overloads of the AddExceptionless method
for different configuration options.

Please visit the documentation https://exceptionless.com/docs/clients/dotnet/sending-events/
for examples on sending events to Exceptionless.

---

Manually reporting an exception
-------------------------------

By default the Exceptionless Client will report all unhandled exceptions. You can
also manually send an exception by importing the Exceptionless namespace and calling
the following method.

exception.ToExceptionless().Submit()

Please note that ASP.NET Core doesn't have a static http context. We recommend registering
the http context accessor. Doing so will allow the request and user information to be populated.
You can do this by calling the AddHttpContextAccessor while configure services.

services.AddHttpContextAccessor()
